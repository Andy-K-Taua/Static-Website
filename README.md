# Zolo

This project is a research project that plays with the idea of a piggy back AI method, giving the end user permissions over windows. This outputs AI generated outcomes. 

## Features

* Feature 1 - Super lightweight frontend, no loading
* Feature 2 - Costs nothing
* Feature 3 - Piggy backs ANY AI LLM

## Future Improvements

1. I would like to make 3 buttons in total
2. I would try to reduce the amount of clicks required to final output
